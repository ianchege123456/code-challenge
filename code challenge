Speed Demerit Point Calculator
Description
This program takes as input the speed of a car and calculates demerit points for speeding violations. If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70 km/h), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.

How to Use
Input Speed: Run the program and follow the prompts to enter the speed of the car.

View Demerit Points: The program will then display the total number of demerit points, if any.

Example

Enter the speed of the car (km/h): 80
Demerit Points: 2

Enter the speed of the car (km/h): 65
Ok
